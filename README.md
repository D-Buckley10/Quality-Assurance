How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  There are a few ways that I can ensure that my code of software is funtional and secure. One of those methods involve JUnit testing, one of the core concepts of dynamic testing that was taught to us this semester. Additionally, spending a considerable amount of time static testing and making sure that your "checklist" is complete on what should be tested in the program can help save time during the testing and debugging portion of development. Both forms of testing should be used in combination since there are benefits and limitations to both of the testing methods. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  When gathering user needs, it's important to consider what is being asked of the program. For instance, one of the requirements for the contact service was that the first name and last name cannot be longer than 10 characters each or null. In order to incorporate this, I made sure to run a loop that would check to see if the first or last name were longer than 10 characters or null. If this condition was met, then an error would be throw that would produce an error message for the user that would state that the name is invalid. Making sure to be as clear as possible with the customer is of greatest importance, as it could be easy for there to be mistranslation in what the customer wants and what the developer can achieve for them. 

How do I approach designing software?

  When it comes to how I design software, I like to gather as many requirements as possible about the product I will be creating. This involves gathering a form of checklist, as mentioned earlier, of everything the customer needs from the program. This can include the core features that the program will be running on or the certain limitations that the user would like in place when using the software. After this, I attempt to write pseudocode of the program to help envision how I will have to structure the program. During the coding portion of creating the program, I attempt to check off my list as well before running any code. I also check for any errors that are provided from the IDE that I am using to develop the program, in this case that IDE was "Eclipse". Once I've checked for all the errors, then I begin dynamic testing to ensure that the behavior of the program is running as intended. If it happens to crash or not behave as inteded, then the debugging process will begin.
